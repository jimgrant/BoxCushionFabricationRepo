    <h2>Box Cushion Fabrication</h2>
    <p>
        Anyone with a sewing machine and a little time can build beautiful, colorful, and comfortable cushions. This app should aid that process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hit the "eBook" tab to access a 15,800 word instruction manual with lots of illustrations and construction detail.

    </p>
    <p>
        And don't overlook the third tab -- it gives access to the most accurate way to determine the yardage needed for any box cushion project. There has never been an easier or more accurate way to gauge needed fabric. And cutting instructions that make optimum use of the fabric are generated. Depending upon the firmness and the thickness of the filler used, plate and boxing sizes are adjusted so fit and finish remain consistent no matter how diverse the cushion elements. And pattern repeats are automatically centered and matched top to bottom cushion to cushion!

    <p>
        The fourth tab gives access to web videos that clearly demonstrate techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
        Supplies can be ordered or information sought without leaving this App: the fifth tab leads directly to the Sailrite Web Site.
